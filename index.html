           C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 11, was released in November 2022.

            C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 11 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the introduction to C# tutorials.

            C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.

          To get started with writing c#, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" c# code: <code>
    // Hello World! program
namespace HelloWorld 
{</code>
<code>
    class Hello {         
        static void Main(string[] args)
        { </code>
          <code> System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>
  <code>      }</code>
<code>    }
};
          </code>

         <p> Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!</p>
